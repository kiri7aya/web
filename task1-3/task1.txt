What is a Framework?

A framework is a structured foundation of reusable code, tools, libraries, or resources 
that provide a standardized way to develop and organize software applications. 
Frameworks offer pre-built functions, modules, and conventions, allowing developers to focus 
on the applicationâ€™s unique aspects rather than common programming tasks. For instance, web 
frameworks like Django for Python or Ruby on Rails for Ruby streamline web application development 
by handling routing, database interactions, and user authentication.
