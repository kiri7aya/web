Differences and Advantages of Frameworks

Differences: Frameworks vary by language, use case, architecture, and purpose:

Programming Language: Some frameworks are language-specific, like Angular for JavaScript and Spring for Java.
Purpose: Frameworks often cater to specific needs (e.g., Flask for minimalistic web applications vs. Django for full-featured applications).
Architecture: Many frameworks support MVC (Model-View-Controller), while others support MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) or component-based architecture (e.g., React).
Size and Complexity: Frameworks range from lightweight and fast (e.g., Express for Node.js) to feature-rich and robust (e.g., .NET).
Advantages:

Consistency: Frameworks enforce best practices, making code more consistent across teams.
Productivity: By providing pre-built tools, frameworks allow developers to quickly set up functionality and focus on custom features.
Maintenance: Frameworks often have large communities, meaning frequent updates, security patches, and extensive documentation.
Scalability: Many frameworks are optimized for scaling applications, providing modular structures that make it easier to add new features over time.
